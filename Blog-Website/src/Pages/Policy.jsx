            <li><strong>No Bug, No Glory:</strong> If you find a bug, congratulations! You‚Äôre now our unofficial QA team. Report it, and we might even fix it... eventually. </li>

            <li><strong>Code or Be Coded Out:</strong> If you're here to just lurk and not contribute anything useful, we totally understand. But just know, our imaginary judgmental bot is watching.</li>
            <li><strong>Debugging is a Lifestyle:</strong> If your code runs perfectly on the first try, we don‚Äôt trust you. Either you‚Äôre an AI, or you‚Äôve made a deal with the dark side of programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Copy-Paste With Caution:</strong> Stack Overflow is your best friend, but if you copy-paste without understanding, we reserve the right to roast you mercilessly.</li>
            <li><strong>Dark Mode or Disownment:</strong> If you prefer light mode, please take a moment to reconsider your life choices. (Just kidding... or are we?)</li>
            <li><strong>Deploy, Then Panic:</strong> Ship your code with confidence. Then refresh the page 500 times to make sure nothing exploded.</li>
            <li><strong>‚ÄúIt Works on My Machine‚Äù is NOT a Bug Report:</strong> If your code only works in that one weird environment on your laptop, it doesn‚Äôt actually work. Sorry to break it to you.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect the Devs (Even the Ones Who Use Tabs):</strong> We don‚Äôt judge based on your choice of spaces vs. tabs... but just know, your editor will.</li>
            <li><strong>Coffee is Mandatory (Tea is Acceptable):</strong> If you‚Äôre coding without caffeine, are you even coding? Hydration is great and all, but let's be real‚Äîcoffee runs this place.</li>
            <li><strong>Rule #10? Who Reads This Far Anyway?</strong> If you've made it this far, congratulations. You have the patience of a backend developer debugging a production issue. You belong here.</li>
